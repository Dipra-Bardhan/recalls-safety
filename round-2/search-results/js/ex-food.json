      "text": "<p>\n OTTAWA – Health Canada is advising Canadians that soft-shelled hyperbaric chambers that are promoted online or offered as a service to treat a variety of medical conditions—including autism, cerebral palsy and migraines—are unauthorized medical devices and may pose serious health risks, including death.</p>\n<p>\n Oxygen therapy using hard-shelled hyperbaric chambers is a well-established medical treatment where patients are placed in an oxygen-rich and pressurized environment. While Health Canada has licensed five hard-shelled hyperbaric chambers for sale in Canada, it has not licensed any soft-shelled devices, meaning they have not been evaluated for safety, quality and effectiveness.</p>\n<p>\n To date, Health Canada has not received any evidence supporting the benefits of the soft-shelled version of these devices, and manufacturers have not demonstrated that the soft-shelled models are effective for treating any medical conditions.</p>\n<p>\n Potential risks associated with the use of soft-shelled hyperbaric chambers include:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  fire or explosion as a result of static discharge within an elevated oxygen environment;</li>\n <li>\n  disease spread through cross-contamination between users;</li>\n <li>\n  damage to the ears, eyes, sinuses, lungs and teeth; and</li>\n <li>\n  changes to blood sugar levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n The risk of fire is significantly increased when the device is used in combination with an oxygen concentration device.</p>\n<p>\n Under the <a href=\"https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-98-282/\"><em>Medical Devices Regulations</em></a>, it is illegal in Canada to advertise medical devices for sale, to import them for sale, or to sell them without appropriate licensing.</p>\n<p>\n To learn more, visit Health Canada’s <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/medical-information/hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy.html\">Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy</a> webpage.</p>\n<h2>\n Who is affected?</h2>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  Patients who are receiving treatments in a soft-shelled hyperbaric chamber <strong> </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n What should consumers do?</h2>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n <li>\n  Do not purchase soft-shelled hyperbaric chambers online or obtain treatment from third parties using these products.</li>\n <li>\n  Consult your healthcare professional if you use or have used a soft-shelled hyperbaric chamber and you have concerns about your health.</li>\n <li>\n  Check whether medical devices have been licensed for sale by searching Health Canada's <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medical-devices/licences/medical-devices-active-licence-listing.html\">Medical Devices Active Licence Listing</a>.</li>\n <li>\n  Report complaints involving <a href=\"http://health.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/compliance-enforcement/problem-reporting/health-product-complaint-form-0317.html\">medical devices</a>, including the sale of unauthorized devices, to Health Canada.</li>\n <li>\n  <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/services/health/stay-connected.html\">Stay connected</a> with Health Canada and receive the latest advisories and product recalls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n What Health Canada is doing</h2>\n<p>\n Health Canada is asking companies that sell unauthorized soft-shelled hyperbaric chambers to immediately stop selling these devices and to conduct a recall. Health Canada is advising importers, distributors and manufacturers that it is illegal to advertise, import for sale, or sell these devices in Canada without appropriate licensing.</p>\n<p>\n Health Canada is contacting provincial and territorial authorities, as well as clinics and other types of establishments that offer treatments with soft-shelled hyperbaric chambers, to advise them of the medical device licensing requirements and the risks associated with using soft-shelled hyperbaric chambers. The Department is also working with the Canada Border Services Agency to help prevent further importation of these unauthorized medical devices.</p>"
